# Job Discovery and Scoring

## Search Profiles

Search profiles are reusable job-search strategies. They define:

- target titles
- included and excluded keywords
- industries
- locations
- remote preference
- compensation floor
- seniority
- schedule settings
- minimum score threshold
- profile health and notes

Profiles can be active, paused, or archived.

## Company Source List

The company source list is a target source list, not a claim that each company is currently hiring.

The app prioritizes companies and roles around:

- React
- TypeScript
- Next.js
- full-stack product engineering
- design systems
- security and identity
- AI tooling
- developer platforms
- internal tools
- data-rich UIs
- defense tech
- geospatial
- visualization
- SaaS admin consoles
- enterprise dashboards

## Source Adapters

The app supports job ingestion from:

- company sites
- Greenhouse
- Lever
- Ashby
- manual capture
- selected job boards where appropriate

The source configuration can store company slugs and adapter settings.

## Manual Job Capture

Jobs can be added manually through the app or through the Chrome extension. Captured jobs are normalized, deduped, saved, and then scored when possible.

Chrome capture also learns from selection intent. When a captured job produces zero matching profiles, the system creates an enabled captured-intent profile and scores the captured job against it immediately. The first generated lane is `AI-Native Enterprise Product Frontend`, combining the preferred career direction of AI-native product/frontend work with broader senior frontend/product engineering defaults for urgent search coverage.

## Market Intelligence

The Profiles page includes a weekly market intelligence brief. The `MARKET_INTELLIGENCE` agent compares recent matched jobs, profile health, application outcomes, skill mentions, and company patterns against curated external labor-market sources.

The report is advisory. It shows lane demand, skill-signal charts, cited source links, data freshness, confidence, and review-only actions for profile tuning, positioning, company targeting, and outreach. It does not automatically create, edit, pause, or delete search profiles.

## Duplicate and Stale Detection

The Duplicate/Stale Job Detector looks for:

- same company and title
- same source job ID
- same application URL
- stale or old job data
- duplicate groups

Duplicates and stale roles are down-ranked or grouped so the user does not waste review time.

## Scoring

The scoring model separates three ideas:

### Fit Score

How well the candidate matches the role.

Signals include:

- title fit
- required skills
- preferred skills
- seniority
- SaaS/frontend/full-stack fit
- industry relevance
- project relevance
- evidence strength

### Opportunity Score

Whether the role is worth time.

Signals include:

- compensation
- remote/location fit
- job freshness
- company/source quality
- strategic career value
- likely callback value
- duplicate/stale status

### Confidence Score

How confident the system is in the evaluation.

Signals include:

- completeness of the job description
- amount and quality of candidate evidence
- salary/location clarity
- ambiguity in title or requirements
- source reliability

## Recommended Actions

Possible recommendations:

- `APPLY_NOW`
- `MAYBE_APPLY`
- `SAVE_FOR_LATER`
- `REJECT`
- `NEEDS_REVIEW`

Every score should include rationale, strengths, risks, missing keywords, and evidence references where applicable.
