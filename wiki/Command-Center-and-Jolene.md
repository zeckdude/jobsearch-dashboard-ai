# Command Center and Jolene

## Command Center

The Command Center is the main operating page for the job search system. It replaces the old linear "step" flow with a live operating view.

It shows:

- latest search run state
- live search progress
- jobs found, deduped, filtered, and saved
- open blockers
- application packet review needs
- application pipeline counts
- daily plan actions
- links to high-priority work

## Live Search Updates

The search run command center reads the latest `JobSearchRun` and displays meaningful progress while a run is active.

Tracked run data includes:

- status: running, completed, failed, partial
- trigger: manual or cron
- started and finished timestamps
- profile IDs searched
- jobs fetched
- jobs after dedupe
- jobs after filters
- jobs saved
- progress entries
- errors

The goal is for the user to see what the search system is actually doing instead of only seeing a spinner.

## Apply Sprint Agency Command Center

The Apply Sprint page has a dedicated Agency command center for the application workflow. It uses a primary action panel for running the recruiting agency and showing live graph activity, plus a separate operations panel for packet preparation, packet sync, sprint-console access, and launching the next ready application.

This keeps the main agency workflow visually distinct from secondary actions and avoids mixing stateful run status, select inputs, and action buttons in one uneven toolbar.

## Daily Plan

The daily command center agent can produce a short action list from current jobs, applications, blockers, follow-ups, and profile health.

Examples:

- review high-fit jobs
- generate packets for approved jobs
- resolve open questions
- follow up on stale applications
- improve a noisy search profile

## Jolene

Jolene is the persistent assistant available on every screen from a floating "Ask Jolene" button.

Jolene is context-aware. The app passes the current route and relevant local data to Jolene so she can answer questions like:

- Why is this job being shown?
- What score or signal caused this recommendation?
- What should I do next on this page?
- What blocker is stopping this application?
- Which setting controls this behavior?
- How should future search parameters change?

Jolene also has app-aware local retrieval tools. Before falling back to a general LLM answer, she can search generated cover letters, generated materials, application packets, application trackers, and job records. This supports direct operational requests such as:

- Where is the cover letter for Linear?
- Show me application materials for Terzo.
- Find the application for a specific company or role.
- Open the job record for a company.

When Jolene finds a match, she returns direct links to the relevant local pages and exports, including generated cover-letter text/PDF routes, generated materials, application detail, and job detail. She does not include full cover-letter bodies in default answers; she points to the stored material unless the user explicitly asks for content.

## ADK App Operator

Jolene has an ADK-backed app-operator layer for broader app operations. Exact lookups and career coaching still run through deterministic tools first, but operational requests can now be planned as ADK tool activity.

Jolene can directly run safe internal actions:

- run a fresh job search
- check duplicate and stale jobs
- sync job-response email
- refresh the Daily Command Center
- refresh Market Intelligence
- diagnose cross-page state drift such as applied jobs still appearing in ready-to-apply queues

Jolene must ask for confirmation before guarded actions:

- approving, rejecting, archiving, deleting, or bulk-changing jobs or applications
- repairing state, retrying/cancelling agent runs, or disabling learned rules
- sending email/outreach, submitting applications, or interacting with external employer systems

Confirmed operator actions are shown as inline cards under Jolene messages. The user can confirm or cancel the exact plan Jolene proposed. Confirmed execution is intentionally limited to app-local internal repairs:

- application integrity repair
- duplicate/stale job detection
- job-response email sync
- Daily Command Center refresh
- Market Intelligence refresh
- graph-backed agent run repair, retry, or cancel when the plan includes a run id

External actions are never executed by Jolene. Submitting applications, sending email or outreach, interacting with employer systems, and broad approve/reject/archive changes remain manual or page-routed even if Jolene can explain the plan.

Operator activity is stored on Jolene messages as planned, confirmed, executed, skipped, failed, or cancelled actions so the UI and future agent-review surfaces can show what Jolene did, what she skipped, and what requires confirmation. `POST /api/jolene/confirm` validates the stored message plan, checks the internal-repairs boundary, rejects expired or mismatched plans, updates the source message, and appends an execution result message.

## Career-Aware Coaching

Jolene can answer interview and positioning questions from local career context. When a user pastes recruiter guidance or asks how a success profile applies to their background, Jolene loads compact evidence from:

- candidate profile summaries, roles, skills, domains, and industries
- approved candidate evidence
- work experiences, projects, and experience bullets
- application outcomes and interview-stage signals
- recent app-building themes such as agentic workflows, RAG, LangGraph, automation, and quality loops

This path is non-mutating. Pasted recruiter text containing words like "email", "review", or "interview" should not trigger email sync unless the user explicitly asks Jolene to check or sync email. Career coaching answers map prompts to evidence-backed talking points, likely gaps, and metrics to prepare.

## Jolene Persistence

Jolene stores conversations in:

- `JoleneConversation`
- `JoleneMessage`

Conversation history is scoped by user and page context, so a job-detail conversation can remain attached to that job while settings or dashboard conversations stay separate.

## Voice

Jolene supports browser-native voice features where supported:

- microphone dictation through Web Speech recognition
- spoken replies through browser speech synthesis

Voice is optional and controlled from Jolene's drawer.

## Route Contexts

Jolene currently builds specialized context for:

- dashboard
- jobs list
- job detail
- applications
- application detail
- Apply Sprint
- Needs Me
- Settings

For unknown routes, she falls back to general workflow help and navigation guidance.
