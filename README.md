# Job Search OS

Personal AI-powered job search dashboard for reviewing jobs, maintaining search profiles, parsing resumes, and generating truthful ATS-friendly application materials.

## Local Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the Docker PostgreSQL database:

```bash
npm run db:up
```

Run migrations and seed data:

```bash
npm run prisma:migrate
npm run prisma:seed
```

Start the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

Run the full local Docker stack instead:

```bash
docker compose --profile full up --build
```

That starts Postgres with pgvector, Redis, the Next.js app on `http://localhost:3000`, runs deployed migrations in the app and worker containers, and starts an embeddings worker. On a brand-new Docker database, seed the app once from another terminal:

```bash
docker compose --profile full exec app npm run prisma:seed
```

To run only the containerized app without the worker:

```bash
docker compose --profile app up --build app
```

To run only the embeddings worker:

```bash
docker compose --profile worker up --build worker
```

Smoke test the main UI pages against a running local or Docker app:

```bash
npm run smoke:pages
# or
SMOKE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 npm run smoke:pages
```

## Optional Providers

The app works without external service keys by using deterministic local fallbacks. Add these when you want provider-backed behavior:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini
RESEND_API_KEY=...
# or
POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN=...
NOTIFICATION_FROM_EMAIL="Job Search OS <jobs@example.com>"
PUSHOVER_USER_KEY=...
PUSHOVER_APP_TOKEN=...
```

With `OPENAI_API_KEY`, resume parsing, job scoring, and resume tailoring use OpenAI structured outputs. Without it, those flows still run through deterministic parsers/scorers so the dashboard remains usable.

Set your GitHub profile URL in `/settings` and click `Sync GitHub context` to pull public repository context into the candidate profile. Public repos are used as project context in tailored resumes and cover letters when relevant. Add `GITHUB_TOKEN` only if you need higher GitHub API rate limits.

The manual search run uses enabled external source adapters. Direct ATS sources are prioritized: Greenhouse, Lever, and Ashby. RemoteOK is disabled by default because it creates paid/login application friction, and We Work Remotely is disabled by default because it is an intermediary board rather than a final ATS form. ATS adapters use configured company slugs so the app can search target companies directly, for example:

```json
{ "companySlugs": ["linear", "vercel"] }
```

The seeded `Company Source List` is a curated target list, not a claim that every company is hiring today. Search runs probe likely company careers/ATS feeds from that list, filter for role families such as React, TypeScript, Next.js, design systems, security/identity, AI tooling, developer platforms, defense tech, geospatial, and enterprise dashboards, then score the resulting roles against enabled profiles.

Scheduled job search runs are configured in `vercel.json` and call `/api/cron/job-search` daily at `14:00 UTC`. Scheduled runs only use enabled profiles where scheduling is enabled. Set `CRON_SECRET` in the deployment environment to require `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>` on cron requests.

## Local Playwright Application Assistant

The app does not submit applications automatically. For jobs marked `ready_to_apply`, you can run a local browser assistant that fills safe known fields, uploads the generated resume and cover letter when matching inputs are visible, then stops before submit.

Install local browser automation dependencies:

```bash
npm run assistant:install
```

Prepare an application package in the app, then click `Launch assistant` on `/applications` or the job detail page. The CLI command remains available for debugging:

```bash
npm run assistant:apply -- <application-id>
```

The assistant will:

- open the job application URL in a local Chromium window
- fill safe fields such as name, email, phone, location, LinkedIn, GitHub, and portfolio
- upload the generated resume PDF and cover letter text file when matching upload controls exist
- prepare selected application-question answers as a local text file when you have chosen an answer option in the packet review page
- highlight likely submit buttons and wait for your manual review

The assistant will not:

- click submit
- bypass CAPTCHA or human verification
- use stealth browser settings
- rotate proxies
- answer sensitive demographic questions automatically

Application-question workflow:

1. Open `Apply Sprint`.
2. Select the ready application.
3. Paste a written employer prompt into `Application question helper`.
4. Generate grounded answer options.
5. Open the application packet, review the saved options, and click `Use this` on the answer you want.
6. Launch the assistant.

Selected answers are added to `assistant-package.json` and written next to the generated resume and cover letter as:

```txt
<Candidate> - <Company> - <Role> - Application Answers.txt
```

The assistant still leaves custom question fields untouched. Copy selected answers manually during the final browser review.

Some job boards require Google OAuth, human verification, or paid apply flows. Those sources are disabled by default or treated as manual-only: the assistant opens the job in your normal browser and reveals the prepared materials folder instead of trying to automate the login.

## MCP Server

The repo includes a first-class MCP server for agents and Docker-based MCP clients. It exposes the Job Search OS as tools over stdio while sharing the same Prisma/Postgres data as the dashboard.

Local stdio run:

```bash
npm run mcp:server
```

Docker image:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.mcp -t job-search-os-mcp .
docker run -i --rm \
  --env-file .env \
  -e JOB_SEARCH_OS_APP_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3000 \
  job-search-os-mcp
```

Docker Compose profile:

```bash
docker compose --profile mcp up --build mcp
```

Available MCP tools:

- `get_dashboard_summary`
- `run_job_search`
- `get_search_run`
- `list_review_queue`
- `list_jobs`
- `get_job_detail`
- `set_job_match_status`
- `prepare_application_package`
- `bulk_prepare_application_packages`
- `list_applications`
- `update_application_status`
- `sync_github_context`
- `get_candidate_profile`

The MCP server can prepare application packages and update tracking state, but it does not submit applications.

## Database

The app uses Docker Postgres by default:

```txt
postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5433/job_search_os?schema=public
```

Docker maps host port `5433` to container port `5432` so it does not conflict with a local Postgres service already running on `5432`.

Useful commands:

```bash
npm run db:up
npm run db:logs
npm run db:down
npm run db:reset
npm run smoke:pages
```

## Evidence Worker

Evidence embeddings can be generated from the dashboard with `Embed evidence`, or by running the worker:

```bash
npm run worker:embeddings
```

Worker environment knobs:

```txt
EMBEDDINGS_WORKER_INTERVAL_MS=600000
EMBEDDINGS_WORKER_BATCH_SIZE=50
EMBEDDINGS_WORKER_BACKFILL_EVIDENCE=false
```

The worker never generates application materials or submits applications. It only syncs evidence chunks and embeddings for retrieval.
